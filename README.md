# Overview

The program in C++ begins by storing hospital staff and patient information. It allows adding new patient and staff records by collecting their details through user input. For patient management, the system can admit new patients, assign them to doctors, and update their status as treated or discharged. For staff management, the system records staff details, including their roles and contact information. The system also includes functions to display the lists of patients and staff, providing options to view specific details like patient history or staff assignments. The overall goal is to streamline hospital operations by organizing and managing patient and staff information efficiently.
